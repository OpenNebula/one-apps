# Default configuration attributes for the KVM driver
# (all domains will use these values as defaults).  These values can
# be overridden in each VM template. Valid atributes are:
#  - emulator
#  - os [kernel,initrd,boot,root,kernel_cmd,arch]
#  - vcpu
#  - features [acpi, pae]
#  - disk [driver, cache, io]
#  - nic  [filter, model]
#  - raw

#EMULATOR = /usr/libexec/qemu-kvm

#VCPU = 1

OS       = [ boot = "hd", arch = "i686" ]
FEATURES = [ PAE = "no", ACPI = "yes" ]

DISK     = [ driver = "raw" , cache = "none"]

#NIC     = [ filter = "clean-traffic", model="virtio" ]
#RAW     = "<devices><serial type=\"pty\"><source path=\"/dev/pts/5\"/><target port=\"0\"/></serial><console type=\"pty\" tty=\"/dev/pts/5\"><source path=\"/dev/pts/5\"/><target port=\"0\"/></console></devices>"

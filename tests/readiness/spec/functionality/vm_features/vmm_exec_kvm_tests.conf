# Default configuration attributes for the KVM driver

#  - os [kernel,initrd,boot,root,kernel_cmd,arch,machine,sd_disk_bus]
#  - vcpu
#  - memory_slots: number of memory slots for hotplug memory
#  - graphics [type, listen, passwd, keymap, random_passwd]
#  - features [acpi, pae, apic, hyperv, localtime, guest_agent, virtio_scsi_queues]
#  - cpu_model [model]
#  - disk [driver, cache, io, discard, total_bytes_sec, total_iops_sec, read_bytes_sec, write_bytes_sec, read_iops_sec, write_iops_sec]
#  - nic  [filter, model]
#  - raw
#  - hyperv_options: options used for FEATURES = [ HYPERV = yes ]
# NOTE: raw attribute value is appended to that on the VM template

# OpenNebula Apps

The OpenNebula Apps project offers a comprehensive suite of tools to construct specialized appliances tailored for your OpenNebula cloud environment. Within this repository, you'll find:

* Contextualization packages designed for both Linux and Windows operating systems. These packages facilitate seamless integration of VM guests with OpenNebula by configuring networking, user accounts, SSH keys, and enabling the execution of custom startup scripts, among various other operations.
* Packer build scripts crafted to generate contextualized qcow2 disk images compatible with a variety of standard Linux OS distributions.
* The Virtual Router (VR) appliance, delivering multiple virtualized network functions (VNFs) to enhance network operations within your cloud setup.
* The OneKE appliance, streamlining the deployment of a Kubernetes platform, ensuring a more efficient and optimized experience.

The artifacts built through the OpenNebula Apps project are regularly published on the OpenNebula Marketplace, allowing you to [download them instantly](https://marketplace.opennebula.io/).

Previously, OpenNebula Team maintained two different repositories for the Linux and Windows contextualization packages:
* [addon-context-linux](https://github.com/OpenNebula/addon-context-linux)
* [addon-context-windows](https://github.com/OpenNebula/addon-context-windows)

Both of them were merged here, together with the image building tools. The original repositories has been archived, please use this one to get the latest release or to report any issues.
